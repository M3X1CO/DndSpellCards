Teeraturos Tyraturos the city of war! a city where wealth and misery exist side by side, a place where the fortunes of the few are built on the suffering of the many.

Teeraturos is a city where the art of war is elevated to an obsession, a place where the living and the dead fight side by side for the glory of Thay.

Pyarados is a city where fire is both a tool and a master, a place where the land itself is as dangerous as the magic that shapes it.

The forges of pyarados supply the undead armies of thay and require the ring of winter for cooling?

Szass Tam the lich and 8 Zulkir of Thay became the leaders of Thay. Council of Zulkirit. The regional governors Tharchions.

The Ring of Winter would be extremely valuable to the Red Wizards of Thay for several reasons:

Immense Power: The Ring of Winter is an incredibly powerful artifact that grants control over ice and cold magic, which would significantly enhance their magical capabilities.
Eternal Life: The Ring is known to grant immortality to its wearer - something the Red Wizards constantly seek through means like lichdom and other magic.
Strategic Value: The ability to create extreme cold and manipulate ice on a large scale would give Thay a significant military advantage, particularly since their nation is known for its warm climate.
Research Value: As master mages obsessed with magical power, the Red Wizards would be extremely interested in studying such a powerful artifact to understand its magic and potentially replicate its effects.
Political Power: Possessing such a powerful artifact would increase Thay's standing among other nations and potentially help them expand their influence.

Given the Red Wizards' constant pursuit of power and magical knowledge, any powerful magical artifact would be of great interest to them, but the Ring of Winter's particular powers align well with their goals of achieving power and immortality.
