In the land of **Chult**, a resource that can store arcane energy and has similar properties to **Chardalyn** from the *Icewind Dale* setting is **Eldritch Resin**, specifically in the context of certain Dungeons & Dragons materials.

While **Chardalyn** itself is a specific material tied to the *Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden* campaign, Chult is a land rich with unique and often dangerous magical properties, and several magical resources from Chult are known to have mystical properties, though not all of them are directly tied to arcane energy storage. However, there are a few notable magical resources that could serve as inspiration for items that store arcane energy or are linked to arcane magic.

### **Eldritch Resin**
In the *Tomb of Annihilation* adventure (set in Chult), **Eldritch Resin** is a material harvested from ancient trees in the jungles of Chult, particularly those growing near the heart of ancient magical forces. While the resin itself isn't commonly described as an energy storage medium in the official text, its connection to the magical energies of Chult could theoretically allow it to act as a vessel for arcane power. For example, this resin could be used in creating magical items or even as an ingredient in potions that store or channel arcane energy.

- **Potential Use**: Eldritch Resin could be used to craft objects that store spells or magical energy, much like how **Chardalyn** is used to craft dangerous, energy-holding items. 
- **Magical Properties**: It could serve as a conduit for storing magical power, potentially allowing spellcasters to imbue it with spells or energy, much like the way certain magical items can absorb or store spell charges in other campaign settings.

### **The Heart of Chult**
There are also more legendary and abstract sources of magical energy in Chult, like the **Heart of Chult** (sometimes associated with the **Fang of Rovagug**, an artifact mentioned in *Tomb of Annihilation*), which is said to hold arcane or primal forces. Though this specific item doesn't directly store arcane energy like Chardalyn, it could be imagined as an artifact capable of doing so, or a source of such power. These forces could be harnessed by those brave (or foolish) enough to seek them out.

### **Other Chultian Magical Resources (Homebrew Potential)**
- **Jadeite Crystals**: Chult is known for its vast jungles and ancient ruins, many of which are rich in **jade** and **jadeite** crystals. In homebrew settings, these could be envisioned as magical items or resources that store arcane energy, used by wizards, druids, or shamans who seek to harness the region's primal magic.
- **Cinderstone**: In a more homebrew scenario, a volcanic stone or gemstone found in the volcanic regions of Chult might be designed to absorb magical energy due to its inherent mystical properties. 

### Conclusion
While **Chardalyn** specifically is tied to the **Icewind Dale** setting, the **Eldritch Resin** from Chult, with its connection to the region's magical and primal forces, could be a fitting equivalent. It could be imagined to store arcane energy or be used to craft magical items capable of doing so. Similarly, **jadeite** or **Cinderstone** could also serve as magical energy conduits in a homebrew Chultian setting. These magical resources would be in line with the exotic and dangerous nature of the Chultan jungle and its many hidden powers.
