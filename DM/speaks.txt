Artus Cimber: (sighs) "The Nagas in Orolunga were cryptic as ever, Dragonbait. They spoke of a cleansing needed across Chult for Mezro to return. But they did give us some directionâ€”towards Bakumora."

Dragonbait: (emits a scent of burnt wood, indicating frustration or concern)

Artus: "Yes, the very place. They mentioned runes, ancient symbols that might guide us to the real Mezro. 
But the journey will be fraught with danger. The wild magic in Bakumora... it's unpredictable. Remember what happened last time?"

Dragonbait: (a scent of ice, perhaps a reminder of their previous encounter)

Artus: "Exactly, encased in ice because of my blasted ring! But this time, we'll be more cautious. Those runes could be the key to bringing Alisanda back to me, to restoring our home."

Dragonbait: (a scent of honeysuckle, signaling hope or encouragement)

Artus: "I know that smell, my friend. We're close, closer than we've ever been. But first, we need to get out of this cell. We can't let this setback in 
Omu delay us further. Ras Nsi might be gone, but there are still too many obstacles in our path."

Dragonbait: (a scent of baked bread, indicating anger or determination)

Artus: "Right, let's not lose our heads. We'll need all our wits about us, especially with the wild magic of Bakumora. If we can decipher those runes, 
Mezro could be within our grasp. But we must be careful - one wrong move with the Ring of Winter, and we might find ourselves in a worse situation than this jail."

This dialogue provides insight into Artus's recent interactions with the Nagas, his plans to explore Bakumora, and his cautious approach due to past 
experiences with the unpredictable magic there. It also sets up potential plot points for your campaign, including an escape from jail and the dangers they'll face in Bakumora with their quest for Mezro.
