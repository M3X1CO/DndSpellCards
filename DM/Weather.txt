Weather conditions
On days that receive heavy rain, thereâ€™s a 25 percent chance of a full-blown tropical storm featuring sheets of rain, high wind, lightning, tall waves at sea, 
and immense surf along the coast. Guides who know the conditions in Chult recommend hunkering down and staying put on these days. 
Travel by river is impossible (canoes are swamped by waves within 15 minutes of launching). If characters insist on traveling by foot, every 
character gains 1 level of exhaustion automatically and must make a successful DC 10 Constitution check or gain another. Skill checks to avoid 
becoming lost are made with disadvantage on storm days.
