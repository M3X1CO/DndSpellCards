You appear in a tropical city under the blazing sun. The familiar sounds of a harbor — creaking ropes, slapping waves, heavy barrels rolling across cobblestones — 
mingle with voices shouting and cursing in an unfamiliar language filled with clicks, inhalations, and singsongy words that make it sound almost musical. 
The aroma of unfamiliar spices and tropical fruit mixes with the wharfside smells of fish, tar, and canvas. 
Your eyes are blurry your head hurts and you have no idea who or where you are or where you come from. 
You can feel the sharp edges of heavy chains around your wrists and ankles. Somehow your wrists and ankles feel accustomed to the metal like it has always been there. 
Someone kicks you and shouts get on your feet. You scramble up noticing companions in similar condition surrounding you. 
Images start flashing in your mind, your life comes flooding back into memory. Your a slave and have become accustomed to this life, however it wasn't always this way. 
You remember your life before slavery and emotions you've repressed come flooding back but you maintain your composure. You start to look around...

This port city is an explosion of color. Buildings are painted in bright shades of blue, green, orange, and salmon pink, or their walls are adorned with 
murals portraying giant reptiles and mythical heroes. Every building sports baskets and clay urns of colorful flowers or is draped in leafy, flowering vines. 
Minstrels in bright clothing adorned with feathers and shells perform on street corners. Multicolored pennants and sun awnings flutter atop the city walls. 
A crowd of children dressed in feathered hats and capes races past you, squealing in delighted terror as a street performer costumed as a big-toothed lizard stomps and roars behind them. 
The whole city seems to be bustling, sweating, laughing, swearing, and singing.

A woman teleports herself directly in front of you, she introduces herself as Syndra Silvane. She has what appears to be 2 pixies or fairies on her shoulder and she 
speaks to them quietly and they whisper back to her. She looks at your group weighing you up with a skeptical look. "Let's be direct" she says, 
Time is the most valuable currency i have at the moment. I have purchased your slavery contracts as i need young adventurers badly. There is an awful curse upon the land. 
The king and queen, many of the royalty and elders in society and all of our brave heroes have recently perished. Anyone that has been brought back to life is suffering 
from a withering disease and dies not long after. We are in need of young adventurer's to solve whats causing this curse.

Chult is a breeding ground for bloodsucking, disease-bearing insects, monstrous reptiles, carnivorous birds, beasts of every variety and Murderous undead. 
The farther one moves from the coast, the more humid, hot, and inhospitable the land becomes. 
I need to know you can handle yourselves. Roll for initiative....

Syndra teleports you into a pen with 5 bunnies with what appears to be a unicorn on their head. You can see Syndra standing outside the gates of the pens. 
She appears to be giggling and the faeries appear to be exchanging a gold coin.

She say's "What do you think you would fight me? I am an arch mage you can't touch this.... We have trials for new recruits let's see how you do.

you begin to look around you notice piles of bones everywhere...
A man who was chained to you tries to warn you: play sound bunnies starting

banter  and fight lol

Syndra Silvane cordially invites the party to a friend named Wakanga O’tamu's Home. He’s one of seven merchant princes who rule the city.”
A uniformed attendant leads you up a grand staircase to the third floor, then ushers you into a wood-paneled room with a fireplace, 
comfortable chairs, and a heavy table bearing goblets and bottles of wine. The darkly paneled walls are hung with maps and sea charts. Racks, 
shelves, and cabinets hold hundreds of rolled-up maps and charts.

A person is seated in an overstuffed chair near the fire. You can’t discern a gender, because only the person’s head emerges from under a heavy 
blanket draped over the chair, and an embroidered hood and silver mask conceal the wearer’s face. Even the person’s dry, raspy voice provides no clue. 
“Help yourselves to wine, and seat yourselves, friends — I hope I may call you that.”

She says:
I was an adventurer years ago. I died once and was raised from the dead. I have since closed the door on that stage of my life.”
The death curse you’ve heard about has struck me. I don’t know how much longer I’ll last before I perish. Clerics have no help to offer. 
They’re stymied by what is happening.” “My contacts in the Harpers have learned that the cause of the death curse is a necromantic 
artifact called the Soulmonger. According to their sources, the Soulmonger is somewhere in Chult.”
“Chult is a peninsula ringed with mountains and choked with rain forests. Enormous reptiles, hostile goblins, and an army of undead prowl its jungles and ruins. 
Mapping the place has always been nigh impossible, and nothing is known about the region’s current geography beyond a few miles from the coast.”
“Working from dozens of sea charts, log books, and explorers’ journals, at a deniable cost and many ardous hours by my scholars i have assembled everything known about the current state of Chult into one map. 
I’ll provide it to you if you undertake my mission.” She walks through the maps and the city. Gives 1000 gold for supplies.

Then she says she wants you to meet her again once you have leveled up to lvl 5. She introduces you to another guy that comes in Wakanga

Syndra recommends that the characters secure rooms for themselves at either the Thundering Lizard (if they’re looking for a raucous time) or Kaya’s House of Repose 
(if they want a good night’s sleep). Both inns are located near the Red Bazaar (area 18).

She gives them each a magical item and a letter of recomendation then dismisses herself.

Wakanga O’tamu

Deals in magic and lore
Wizard’s Journal. In his collection, Wakanga has a tattered, water-damaged explorer’s journal that was brought out 
of the jungle 15 years ago. It describes a wizard’s explorations of various places in Chult, but not in enough detail to 
locate them on a map. The unnamed author does, however, make many mentions of his only traveling companion: a shield 
guardian named Vorn. If the characters befriend Wakanga, he gives them the journal and shows them on Syndra’s map 
where it was found (he accurately indicates the hex containing the guardian; see “Vorn” in chapter 2 for more information). 
The journal contains a picture of Vorn’s control amulet but provides no clues to the amulet’s current whereabouts. 
As reward for finding and retrieving the construct and its control amulet, Wakanga offers a spellbook containing fifteen 
randomly determined spells (roll a d6 to determine the level of each spell).

Factions
https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/toa/port-nyanzaru#FactionsandTheirRepresentatives

Emerald Enclave

The Emerald Enclave is a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order by rooting out unnatural threats. 
They struggle to keep civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.

Flaming Fist

The Flaming Fist is a mercenary company headquartered in (and fiercely loyal to) Baldur’s Gate. The Fist maintains a permanent 
stronghold in Chult at Fort Beluarian. From there, Flaming Fist patrols strike out into the jungle to “pacify” territory and claim 
lost treasures. The Flaming Fist has already plundered the ruins of Mezro.

Harpers

The Harpers are spellcasters and spies who covertly oppose any abuse of power, magical or otherwise. Working alone or in small 
cells, they gather information throughout Faerûn, analyze the political dynamics in each region or realm, and use what they uncover 
to help the weak, the poor, and the oppressed from behind the scenes. Harpers act openly only as a last resort.

Lords’ Alliance

A number of cities and settlements banded together to form the Lords’ Alliance, a coalition that works actively to eliminate 
threats to their mutual safety and prosperity. The coalition is loose — some might even call it shaky. Alliance leaders push their 
own interests above counterparts from other cities, and operatives seek honor and glory for themselves and their own lords at the 
expense of less powerful members.

Order of the Gauntlet

Members of the Order of the Gauntlet vow to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. Placing their faith in good-aligned 
deities such as Torm, Helm, and Tyr, they bring the strength of their faith, their hearts, and their weapons to bear against villainy.

Red Wizards of Thay

Red Wizards are in Chult to find and steal the Soulmonger for Szass Tam. They’ve occupied the Heart of Ubtao and are using it as a base. 
Their leader is Valindra Shadowmantle. She remains at the Heart of Ubtao while her Thayan minions comb the ruins of Omu for clues to 
the Soulmonger’s whereabouts. For more information on Valindra, see “Heart of Ubtao."

Ytepka Society

The Ytepka Society, also known as the Triceratops Society, is based in Port Nyanzaru and dedicated to preventing any individual or group 
from abusing power and upsetting the natural social order. Its members are primarily neutral good Chultans. In many respects, the society’s 
goals are similar to those of the Harpers.

Zhentarim

The Zhentarim is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence and power base throughout Faerûn. Its members 
pursue wealth and power through any means, though the public face of the organization appears much more benign — the Zhentarim provides 
the best mercenaries money can buy.
