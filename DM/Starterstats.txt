Phoenix Fire

You immolate yourself, consuming your flesh in a cloud of flame 20 feet high and 30 feet in diameter. 
You die (no saving throw, and spell resistance does not apply). Every evil creature within the cloud takes 2d6 points of 
damage per caster level (maximum 40d6). Neutral characters take half damage (and a successful Reflex save reduces 
that further in half ), while good characters take no damage at all. Half of the damage dealt by the spell against any 
creature is fire; the rest results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance 
to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield), and similar magic.
